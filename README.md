# Activity-Calendar-Generator
Created to solve Issue at retirement homes that use a text based calendar builder. 

This Python program was created in order to preserve a reoccuring schedule on a monthly basis. The programmer just needs to Change the string to whatever routine they need, and this will take care of the rest. 

When running, for the month , please input the number of the month without 0. So for example. for January, input 1, not 01. 

Creates three different calendars, one for each floor of the retirement home I worked at. Also contains disclaimers. 

Created by Piotr Morawiec for Generations at Regency in 2016.
